# YumYum - Food Ordering App 🍕🍟

## Note:

This Project first used the Swiggy API to fetch data. But now it uses a custom server to serve data due to some issues with API as Swiggy's API is not public.Due to which many features had to be removed.

Here is the Link to the complete version of the project which used the swiggy API : [Demo Video](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kunal-salunkhe12_reactjs-frontenddevelopment-project-activity-7076582747355439104-n3HW?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
